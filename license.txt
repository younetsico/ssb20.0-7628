7.	CONFIDENTIALITY.  "Confidential Information" means any non-public information that is designated "confidential" or that a reasonable person should understand is confidential, including, but not limited to, the terms of this Agreement, the Software, or related performance test results derived by you, including but not limited to benchmark test results.  Neither party will disclose Confidential Information to any third party without the disclosing party's prior consent. Confidential Information may only be disclosed to individuals that need to know such information, and on the condition that the individual is subject to a written agreement to protect information with terms as protective as this Agreement. For the purposes of this section, the definition of /n software and Customer includes Affiliates of either party.  Confidential Information remains the sole property of the disclosing party; except for rights explicitly granted in this Agreement, the receiving party does not acquire any rights to such Confidential Information.  The duty to protect Confidential Information does not apply to information that is shown to be: (a) available to the public other than by a breach of a confidentiality obligation; (b)  rightfully received from a third party not in breach of a confidentiality obligation; (c)  independently developed by one party without use of the Confidential Information of the other; (d)  known to the recipient at the time of disclosure (other than under a separate confidentiality obligation); (e) produced in compliance with applicable law or court order, provided the other party is given reasonable advance notice of the obligation to produce Confidential Information (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the disclosing party's cost, if the disclosing party wishes to contest the disclosure. Money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for a breach of confidentiality. If either party breaches the confidentiality obligations, the non-breaching party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief without the necessity of posting a bond even if otherwise normally required. Such injunctive or equitable relief is in addition to all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity.  You agree that if you provide us with any suggestions, comments, or other feedback about our Confidential Information ("Feedback") such Feedback is given voluntarily. You also agree that even if you designate such Feedback as confidential, unless the parties enter into a separate subsequent written agreement, the Feedback shall not be confidential and we shall be free to use, disclose, reproduce, license, or otherwise distribute the Feedback in our sole discretion without any obligations or restrictions of any kind, including without limitation, Intellectual Property Rights.
